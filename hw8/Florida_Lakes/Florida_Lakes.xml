        <useconst>This coverage includes every major lake but is not a complete coverage of the lakes in Florida. South Florida is not included in this coverage. Lakes data will likely be updated in the future to include agency developed waterbody IDs for each lake. Also, USGS GNIS naming board will be given the chance to check and approve the determined lake names. If/as this effort is accomplished, GNIS IDs may be added to the attribute data.</useconst>

                <procdesc>GNIS Lake Points were used as reference points to find the lakes. The GNIS points were then checked against the 1995 Digital Ortho Quadrangles (DOQs). The points were then moved if necessary to represent the center of the lakes, or the point most likely to remain water during drought. Other points were added to represent lakes that did not have GNIS points. The names of the points were then checked against the Digital Raster Graphics and other resources. The USGS Hydrography layer was then clipped to the point coverage, so that there was a layer of just the polygons that intersected the points. The polygon coverage was then cleaned up to match the 1995 DOQs and given the appropriate name from the point coverage. The lakes that did not have names were sent to the respective Water Management District lake biologists for QA/QC. Additional QA/QC included the following: A LINK field was developed to ensure point + polygon correspondence 373 Duplicate Names were investigated 252 names had blank spaces before the Name that had to be removed County Names were compared to DEP Standards Unnecessary fields were removed</procdesc>
