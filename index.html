    <h1>Homework 3</h1>

    <h1>Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h1>
    <h2>A globe can never have the same accuracy as a flat map. Therefore, in order to create our best representations of the globe when making virtual models, we must consider the region in which is being mapped and what projection is the most accurate to describe that region. The following maps show their regions of best fit and areas of high distortion. By looking at the orange circle and the red line grid, issues of area, or shape can be decided on.</h2>
    <h1>Spherical Mercator</h1>

    <h2>NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH SNAP BENEFITS IN COUNTIES OF GEORGIA</h2>

<body>
    <h2>These maps represent a percentage of residents in each individual counties overall population who are eligble for snap. The percent was calculated by dividing the number of residents who use snap in each county by the number of people eligible to use snap in those counties.</h2>
    <h3>Quantile Map or Equal Breaks Map: Data is catagorized by creating an equal amount of points in each group. It is good for avoiding outliers and representing varibility. The patterns may not be well visualized and obscure distribution.

    <h3>Jenks or Natural Breaks Map: Data is grouped by clusters in the largest differences between values. It is data specific, best for highly skewed data and not useful if comparing maps built with different data.

    <h2> Algal Bloom Test Sites in Florida With Air Quality Ranges and Untested Sites</h2>
    <h3> Algal blooms are referred to as red tide due to their destructive nature. They occur due to excess nitrogen and phosphorus, found in run-off from commercial fertilizer, and directly contribute to the rapid growth of algae. This overgrowth of algae blocks out sunlight leading to eutrophication and the death of marine life. The surrounding area is ruined by released toxins in the air that can travel up to 10 miles away. These toxins lead to respiratory irritation.</h3>
    <h4> Two methods of Geoprocessing were used: intersection and buffer. Intersection was used to determine areas (points) that contained polygons of all bodies of water in FL in relation to if they contained test sites for algal blooms (points). I then used buffer to document the 10 mile area range around these test sites. My conclusion is that most test sites are concentrated in central FL. Sites are not common in the north or southern parts (gulf or everglades). It is hard to see the inland part of FL without potential poor air quality zones The grey dots are also important to see areas of overlap for the hydrogrphic map and test sites. It can be used to explore new areas to monitor such as those that can lead to drinking water or contain vulnerable species.</h4></4>
