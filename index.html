    <h1>Homework 3</h1>

    <h1>Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h1>
    <h2>A globe can never have the same accuracy as a flat map. Therefore, in order to create our best representations of the globe when making virtual models, we must consider the region in which is being mapped and what projection is the most accurate to describe that region. The following maps show their regions of best fit and areas of high distortion. By looking at the orange circle and the red line grid, issues of area, or shape can be decided on.</h2>
    <h1>Spherical Mercator</h1>
    <h2>Observations - Best at the equator but expands size significantly at the poles (Greenland is way smaller than Africa)</h2>

    <h1>Conic Equidistant</h1>

    <h1>Cylindrical Equal Area</h1>

    <h1>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h1>

    <h1>Miller Cylindrical</h1>
    <h2>Observations - Very uniform circles at equator and above/below until it gets to the extreme ends of the North and South pole where size and shape is distorted.</h2>

    <h1>Loximuthal</h1>
    <h2>Observations - Both North and South pole are distored in shape and size, however the South is more distorted in larger size.</h2>

<h1>Homework 6.2</h1>   
<body>
    <h2>These maps represent a percentage of residents in each individual counties overall population who are eligble for snap. The percent was calculated by dividing the number of residents who use snap in each county by the number of people eligible to use snap in those counties.</h2>
    <h3>Quantile Map or Equal Breaks Map: Data is catagorized by creating an equal amount of points in each group. It is good for avoiding outliers and representing varibility. The patterns may not be well visualized and obscure distribution.

    <h3>Equal Interval Map: Divides the data range into equal catagories. It is best for linear data and is easier to visualize. It may not reflect nuances or variability.

    <h3>Jenks or Natural Breaks Map: Data is grouped by clusters in the largest differences between values. It is data specific, best for highly skewed data and not useful if comparing maps built with different data.
